# 🚗 Vehicle Registration Web Application 
Welcome to the Vehicle Registration Web APP which is a seamless integration of WEB-API and MVC concepts ! This project is a powerful and flexible backend service built with ASP.NET Core 8, designed to streamline user authentication and vehicle management. Whether you're building a fleet management system or a simple vehicle registry, this API provides all the essential features wrapped in a clean, maintainable codebase.

## 🌟 Key Features
### 🔐 User Authentication & JWT Security
- Sign Up & Login: New users can easily sign up and log in to the system. We use secure password hashing and JWT tokens for authentication, ensuring that your user data is safe and protected.
- Role-Based Access Control: Users can only access and manage their own vehicle data, providing a secure and personalized experience.
### 🚙 Comprehensive Vehicle Management
- Add, Edit, & Delete Vehicles: Authenticated users can manage their vehicle details effortlessly. Each vehicle is tied to a specific user, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
- Detailed Records: Store detailed information about each vehicle, including registration number, owner details, vehicle class (e.g., SUV, Hatchback), and fuel type.
### 🛠️ Clean Architecture
- Separation of Concerns: The project follows the Clean Architecture pattern, dividing the codebase into layers—API, Services, Repositories, and Data. This makes the code easy to navigate, extend, and maintain.
- Scalability: The architecture is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for easy integration of additional features or services as your application grows.
### 🗄️ Robust Database Integration
- Entity Framework Core & SQL Server: The API uses Entity Framework Core for seamless database interactions, with SQL Server as the primary database. Enjoy the power of LINQ queries to perform all CRUD operations.
### ⚙️ Middleware & Logging
- Custom Middleware: Handle exceptions gracefully and ensure secure API access with custom middleware.
- Comprehensive Logging: Integrated logging at various levels (Info, Warning, Error) helps you monitor application performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.
